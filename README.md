This project is an example of how to use xml-pull-parser in Android-SDK.
I've collected my expirience about it an pushed to this project.

... and it is a small framework to handle pull-parser easier.


## concept

1. based on XmlPullParser.
2. parser has a reference to a callback-Object. parser call calback-methods for matched tags.
3. parser-states/tags are declared as enum. no special language need to learn.



## usage
